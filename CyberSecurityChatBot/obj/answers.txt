general.how_are_you → I don’t have feelings in the human sense, but I’m here and ready to chat!
general.purpose → My purpose is to provide helpful information, answer questions, and assist with topics like password safety, phishing, and safe browsing.
general.what_can_i_ask → You can ask me about general topics, online security, password safety, phishing threats, and safe browsing practices. Try asking things like:  * [1] ”How can I create a strong password?"  * [2] ”What should I do if I click on a phishing link?"  * [3] ”How do I know if a website is safe?"
password.strength → A strong password is at least 12–16 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid common words, names, or patterns like "123456" or "password."
password.change_frequency → You should change your password if you suspect a breach, but frequently changing passwords unnecessarily can lead to weaker ones. Instead, use a password manager and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
password.reuse_safety → No, reusing passwords is dangerous. If one account is compromised, attackers can access others. Use unique passwords for every site and a password manager to keep track of them.
password.manager → A password manager stores and generates secure passwords for you. It helps you avoid weak passwords and reuse while keeping everything encrypted and accessible with one strong master password.
password.easy_but_strong → Use a passphrase—a series of random words or a sentence with substitutions, like "BlueTurtle$Jumping7Rock!". It’s easier to remember but still strong.
password.length → Yes, longer passwords are generally more secure. A 16+ character password is much harder to crack than an 8-character one, even without special characters.
password.2fa → Yes, always use two-factor authentication (2FA) when available. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, like a text message code or authentication app.
password.passkeys → Passkeys are a passwordless authentication method using cryptographic keys stored on your device. They are more secure than passwords because they can’t be phished or reused across sites.
password.write_down → Writing passwords down is risky unless stored securely. If you must, keep them in a locked, secure place—never in plain sight or on a sticky note near your computer.
password.hacking_methods → Hackers crack passwords using brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing (using leaked passwords from other breaches). Using unique, long passwords with 2FA minimizes the risk.
phishing.definition → Phishing is a cyberattack where scammers trick you into revealing personal information, like passwords or credit card numbers, by pretending to be a trusted source, often through emails, texts, or fake websites.
phishing.recognition → Look for warning signs like urgent requests, generic greetings (“Dear Customer”), poor grammar, suspicious links, and unexpected attachments. Always verify the sender before clicking links or downloading files.
phishing.clicked_link → If you clicked a phishing link, immediately disconnect from the internet, change any affected passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and run a security scan. If you entered sensitive information, monitor your accounts and consider reporting the incident.
phishing.scammer_tactics → Scammers use fear, urgency, and deception to trick people. They might impersonate banks, government agencies, or coworkers, requesting login credentials, payment details, or verification codes.
phishing.types →  * Phishing: Deceptive emails or messages with fake links.  * Smishing: Phishing via SMS/text messages.  * Vishing: Phishing via voice calls, often pretending to be tech support or financial institutions.
phishing.social_media → Yes, phishing happens on social media through fake accounts, malicious links in direct messages, and posts that trick users into entering login details or downloading malware.
phishing.suspicious_email → Don’t click anything. Verify the sender’s email address, hover over links to check their real destination, and report the email as phishing. If it claims to be from a company, contact them directly using their official website.
phishing.obvious_attacks → Not always. Some phishing attacks look nearly identical to real websites or emails from trusted sources. Even cybersecurity experts can be fooled. Always double-check URLs and verify unexpected messages.
phishing.protection → To protect yourself:  * Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accounts.  * Don’t click suspicious links or attachments.  * Verify emails and messages before responding.  * Keep your software and antivirus updated.
phishing.real_examples →  * Fake PayPal alerts: "Your account has been restricted! Click here to verify."  * CEO fraud: Scammers pose as executives asking employees to transfer money.  * Fake job offers: Scammers send fake hiring emails to steal personal data.  * Tech support scams: Calls claiming your computer is infected, asking for remote access.
browsing.website_safety → Check for HTTPS in the URL, look for trust indicators like a padlock icon, avoid sites with too many pop-ups, and verify the domain name to ensure it’s not a fake version of a real site.
browsing.https → HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts data between your browser and a website, making it safer than HTTP. Always prefer HTTPS sites, especially when entering sensitive information.
browsing.browser_extensions → Some browser extensions enhance security, but others can track your activity or contain malware. Only install extensions from reputable sources and review permissions before enabling them.
browsing.download_safety → Only download files from trusted sources. Avoid suspicious pop-ups offering downloads, verify the file type before opening (e.g., .exe files can be dangerous), and use antivirus software to scan downloads.
browsing.vpn → A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and advertisers to track you. It’s useful for protecting privacy, especially on public Wi-Fi.
browsing.password_saving → Browsers can save passwords, but a dedicated password manager is safer. Browser-stored passwords may be vulnerable to malware, while password managers offer better encryption and security.
browsing.tracking → Websites track users with cookies, ads, and scripts. To reduce tracking, use privacy-focused browsers, enable do-not-track settings, block third-party cookies, and consider a tracker-blocking extension.
browsing.cookies → Cookies store website data, like login sessions and preferences. Blocking all cookies can break websites, so it’s best to allow essential cookies while blocking third-party tracking cookies.
browsing.anonymity → To browse anonymously, use Tor Browser, a VPN, or a privacy-focused search engine like DuckDuckGo. Keep in mind that complete anonymity is difficult, as websites can still track fingerprints.
browsing.malware → Malware (malicious software) includes viruses, spyware, and ransomware. Avoid it by not clicking suspicious links, keeping software updated, and using reputable antivirus protection.
